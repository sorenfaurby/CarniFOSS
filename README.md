### CarniFOSS v1.00
A database of the body size of all fossil carnivores 

Welcome to the repo for CarniFOSS

All data on this version currently matches the data in the published paper
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.13369?af=R

In this database, you will find tooth size and estimated body masses for all extant or extinct species within Carnivora, Miacoidea, Hyaenodonta and Oxyaenida. The taxonomy of this database follows the taxonomy of Faurby et al (2019) [here] (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/755207v1.abstract). For most of the extinct species the body masses are imputed based on measurements on their teeth but the database is designed to be complete and it also contains clearly marked size estiamtes inferred solely from phylogeny for a few taxa where we could not fint measurements 

### Data
The database contains seven separate files 
Metadata [here] (https://github.com/sorenfaurby/CarniFOSS/blob/main/Data/Metadata.pdf) explains the logic in the remaining six files

Reported_size [here] (https://github.com/sorenfaurby/CarniFOSS/blob/main/Data/Reported_size.csv) gives raw tooth lenght rapported from literature

Bone_size_Hyaenodonta_and_Oxyaenida [here] (https://github.com/sorenfaurby/CarniFOSS/blob/main/Data/Bone_size_Hyaenodonta_and_Oxyaenida.csv) gives measurement on long-bones on selected Hyaenodonta and Oxyaenida

Precise_body_mass_Carnivoramorpha [here] (https://github.com/sorenfaurby/CarniFOSS/blob/main/Data/Precise_body_mass_Carnivoramorpha.csv) gives source and method of estiamtion for likely more precise body masses inferred from long-bones for extinct species or directly measured for extant ones

References [here] (https://github.com/sorenfaurby/CarniFOSS/blob/main/Data/References.csv) provides the full reference to all information given in the last three files

Inferred_Size_Hyaenodonta_and_Oxyaenida [here] (https://github.com/sorenfaurby/CarniFOSS/blob/main/Data/Inferred_Size_Hyaenodonta_and_Oxyaenida.csv) gives inferred or rapported tooth length and body mass for all Hyaenodonta and Oxyaenida


Inferred_Size_Carnivoramorpha [here] (https://github.com/sorenfaurby/CarniFOSS/blob/main/Data/Inferred_Size_Carnivoramorpha.csv) gives inferred or rapported tooth length and body mass for all Carnivoramorpha i.e. all  Carnivora and Miacoidea

### Improvements
We have tried our very best to collect all availbale information but it is unavoidable that there are a few errors or missing data. We would therefore greatly appreaciate if any user of this database could inform us about disagreements about taxonomy, missing data they have suggestions to how to fill or any values they suspect to be wrong. Plase mail soren.faurby@bioenv.gu.se for any such concerns
