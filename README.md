### CarniFOSS v0.99
A database of the body size of all fossil carnivores 

Welcome to the repo for CarniFOSS

This is a pre-release version of the database but it will likely be very close to the first formal version. 

In this database, you will find tooth size and estimated body masses for all extant or extinct species within Carnivora, Miacoidea, Hyaenodonta and Oxyaenida. The taxonomy of this database follows the taxonomy of Faurby et al (2019) [here] (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/755207v1.abstract). For most of the extinct species the body masses are imputed based on measurements on their teeth but the database is designed to be complete and it also contains clearly marked size estiamtes inferred solely from phylogeny for a few taxa where we could not fint measurements 

The database paper describing the underlying database is currently under review. It is available upon request and will be linked to here ASAP. 

### Data
The database contains seven separate files 
Metadata [here] (https://github.com/sorenfaurby/CarniFOSS/blob/main/Data/Metadata.pdf) explains the logic in the remaining six files

Reported_size [here] (https://github.com/sorenfaurby/CarniFOSS/blob/main/Data/Reported_size.csv) gives raw tooth lenght rapported from literature

Bone_size_Hyaenodonta_and_Oxyaenida [here] (https://github.com/sorenfaurby/CarniFOSS/blob/main/Data/Bone_size_Hyaenodonta_and_Oxyaenida.csv) gives measurement on long-bones on selected Hyaenodonta and Oxyaenida

Bone_size_Carnivoramorpha [here] (https://github.com/sorenfaurby/CarniFOSS/blob/main/Data/Bone_size_%20Carnivoramorpha.csv) gives source and method of calculation of long-bone derived estimates of body mass for selected Carnivoramorpha

References [here] (https://github.com/sorenfaurby/CarniFOSS/blob/main/Data/References.csv) provides the full reference to all information given in the last three files

Inferred_Size_Hyaenodonta_and_Oxyaenida [here] (https://github.com/sorenfaurby/CarniFOSS/blob/main/Data/Inferred_Size_Hyaenodonta_and_Oxyaenida.csv) gives inferred or rapported tooth length and body mass for all Hyaenodonta and Oxyaenida


Inferred_Size_Carnivoramorpha [here] (https://github.com/sorenfaurby/CarniFOSS/blob/main/Data/Inferred_Size_Carnivoramorpha.csv) gives inferred or rapported tooth length and body mass for all Carnivoramorpha i.e. all  Carnivora and Miacoidea

### Improvements
We have tried our very best to collect all availbale information but it is unavoidable that there are a few errors or missing data. We would therefore greatly appreaciate if any user of this database could inform us about disagreements about taxonomy, missing data they have suggestions to how to fill or any values they suspect to be wrong. Plase mail soren.faurby@bioenv.gu.se for any such concerns   


### Citation
Users of this database using it befor publication of the datapaper should just cite this github page. If you are using this pre-release version we would however greatly prefer if you contact us before so we can inform you on when the paper is out which can be cited properly.
